## Bug Challenge

This project is intended as a learning exercise. The challenge is to:

1. Identify and understand each bug documented in the `bugs.json` file
2. Fix the bugs one by one
3. Test your fixes to ensure they work properly
4. Document your process and solutions

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start identifying and fixing the bugs!

## Learning Objectives

- Understand common JavaScript bugs
- Practice debugging skills
- Learn about web storage, event handling, and DOM manipulation
- Experience the software development lifecycle, including bug tracking and fixing

Good luck with the bug fixing challenge!
